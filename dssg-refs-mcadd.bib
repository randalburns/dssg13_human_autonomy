	Abstract = {Team Cornell's Skynet is an autonomous Chevrolet Tahoe built to compete in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. Skynet consists of many unique subsystems, including actuation and power distribution designed in-house, a tightly coupled attitude and position estimator, a novel obstacle detection and tracking system, a system for augmenting position estimates with vision-based detection algorithms, a path planner based on physical vehicle constraints and a nonlinear optimization routine, and a state-based reasoning agent for obeying traffic laws. This paper describes these subsystems in detail before discussing the system's overall performance in the National Qualifying Event and the Urban Challenge. Logged data recorded at the National Qualifying Event and the Urban Challenge are presented and used to analyze the system's performance.},

	Abstract = {The development of autonomous vehicles for urban driving has seen rapid progress in the past 30 years. This paper provides a summary of the current state of the art in autonomous driving in urban environments, based primarily on the experiences of the authors in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge (DUC). The paper briefly summarizes the approaches that different teams used in the DUC, with the goal of describing some of the challenges that the teams faced in driving in urban environments. The paper also highlights the long-term research challenges that must be overcome in order to enable autonomous driving and points to opportunities for new technologies to be applied in improving vehicle safety, exploiting intelligent road infrastructure and enabling robotic vehicles operating in human environments.},
