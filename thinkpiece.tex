\section*{Reference Mission}

To ground the discussion of collaborative human-autonomy systems a reference mission is proposed
that involves human-autonomy teams performing a diverse set of complementary tasks.  The overall
mission objective is to identify thermal signatures representing persons of interest, and to detect and avoid
or disable improvised explosive devices (IEDs) as they are encountered.

This mission, depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:ref-mission}, requires a pervasive collection of human and autonomy teams that
acquire and share data, identify targets, and react appropriately.  In the field, teams of warfighters may be supported by ground and over-the-horizon unmanned aircraft as well as personnel carriers.  The robotic systems can serve as scouts, providing both over-the-horizon and over-the-shoulder situational awareness.  Increased autonomy can enable the human team members to maintain better awareness of their own environment, increasing their effectiveness and reducing risk to themselves.  This risk is particularly high when a teleoperator projects his senses into the robot; if the robot could instead receive high-level commands the soldier could remain more aware and mobile during the operation.  To complement local actors, high-altitude UAVs can provide a bird's-eye view of the operating area, collecting substantial data to share with remote operators and analysts.

In this scenario, ground robots might be responsible for IED detection and disarming to reduce risk to
their human companions.  The human actors that deploy and operate locally would be responsible
for directly observing the environment, interacting with entities in the environment including the local population, and
making real-time decisions based on the mission and their observations.  Hand-carried devices such as [secure] cell phones
can provide the soldier handheld communication and data display capability necessary to interact with local actors and remote operators and analysts in data centers.  Manned vehicles would offer a suite of larger onboard sensors, computers, and communication devices to support the team.  Today, roles and responsibilities are manually determined.  In the future, progress in human-autonomy research can enable a more seamless end-to-end operational paradigm that improves mission effectiveness and efficiency while also reducing risk to soldiers in the field.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

This think piece, and our experiences with the DSSG program in general, were enriched by many, and we would like to acknowledge them here. In particular, visits to LANL (including the Data Science at Scale Team), NRL, Army/Marine facilities, and DARPA led us to consider this as a possible topic and helped us frame the key issues. The use and adoption of technology, as well as the openness of our researchers and troops to their use were clear at many of these stops. Rebecca Grier, Frank Moses, Shelley Cazares at IDA contributed suggestions, references, and thoughtful dialogue on our topic, making our think piece much stronger. A visit to Palantir near the end of our DSSG sessions provided a nice glimpse at how a company has worked with the DoD to enable the adoption of new software and technology to support analysts. We would like to thank Raja Parasuraman (GWU), Scott Galster (AFLR/HE), and Hadas Kress-Gazit (Cornell), each of whom conduct research in related fields (human factors, formal methods), for their patience in answering questions, support with references and ideas, and interesting dialogue on our topic. 

Importantly, we would like to thank the mentors and our DSSG colleagues for making the DSSG experience a truly remarkable one for us at this point in our careers. The discussions about DSSG, DoD and life in general as we made our way around the country were amazing. The mentors have shown us that we can be in awe of them not only for their past service, but their continued selflessness in giving back to this type of program. While we will miss our DSSG colleagues, we know that we have dinner plans any time we travel to your university. We look forward to keeping in touch. 

Finally, we would like to thank Bob Robert and Katie Gliwa. Bob for starting the DSSG program, and coming back to run it now with the enthusiasm of a new DSSG member. And Katie for her remarkable professionalism, organization and wit.
