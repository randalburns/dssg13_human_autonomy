Motivation and Key Research Questions

Why Humans and Autonomy?
Humans and Autonomy must be collaborative
“…the true value of unmanned systems is not to provide a direct human replacement, but rather to extend and complement human capability” (DSB Task Force Report, 2012)

Autonomy must reflect human ethics and decision making
(autonomous systems must) “…allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment…” (A. B. Carter, DoD Directive 3000.09, November 21, 2012)

Ensure that autonomy doesn’t compromise our humanity
“To comply with international humanitarian law, fully autonomous weapons would need human qualities that they inherently lack.” (Human Rights Watch, “Losing Humanity”, November 19, 2012)


Definition of Autonomy
(DoD Autonomy Priority Steering Council, Nov 2012)
Definition of Autonomy: “capability and freedom to self-direct to achieve mission objectives”

“Military Power in the 21st Century will be defined by our ability to adapt – this is THE hallmark of autonomy”
