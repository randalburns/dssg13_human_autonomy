The evolution of autonomy has revealed that the humans need to be inextricably involved in all dimensions of autonomous systems, not 
just managing those systems, but seamlessly integrating human capabilities, human information gathering, and human decision making.

The DSB asserts that the benefits of Autonomy lie in unlimited persistence, reducing risk to humans, and reducing cognitive load.
Autonomy should in no way eliminate or reduces human capabilities.  This lead to shift in thinking in which autonomy is a capability to
be integrated into a complex human-machine system,  rather than a functional replacement for a human.

With this conceptual shift, the question arises: How can autonomy integrate into human-machine systems so that they maximize the 
performance the system as a whole?  Insight into system performance requires measures and models of human performance 
both standalone and in the presence of autonomy and the capability to understand the systems that are multi-scale, complex
networks of humans and autonomy.

Beyond performance, as autonomy grows in complexity, scope, and scale, guarantees that autonomous systems 
operate correctly and within bounds according

\subsection*{Definition of Autonomy}
(DoD Autonomy Priority Steering Council, Nov 2012)
Definition of Autonomy: “capability and freedom to self-direct to achieve mission objectives”

“Military Power in the 21st Century will be defined by our ability to adapt – this is THE hallmark of autonomy”

Key Technical Challenge Areas/Gaps
Human-Autonomy Interaction and Collaboration
Scalability
Machine Intelligence
Verification and Validation

\subsection*{Key Research Questions:}

How do we model, verify, and utilize humans as collaborative decision makers and actors in correct-by-construct autonomous systems?

How do we create multi-scale, model-based autonomy (controllers, communication, and computation) that scales to the battlespace?

How do we co-design complex mission systems to optimally and acceptably incorporate human and autonomy decision-makers and actors?
