@article{Ahmed2013a,
	Abstract = {This study examines the challenging problem of modelling the interaction between individual attentional limitations and decision-making performance in networked human-automation system tasks. Analysis of real experimental data from a task involving networked supervision of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles by human participants shows that both task load and network message quality affect performance, but that these effects are modulated by individual differences in working memory (WM) capacity. These insights were used to assess three statistical approaches for modelling and making predictions with real experimental networked supervisory performance data: classical linear regression, non-parametric Gaussian processes and probabilistic Bayesian networks. It is shown that each of these approaches can help designers of networked human-automated systems cope with various uncertainties in order to accommodate future users by linking expected operating conditions and performance from real experimental data to observable cognitive traits like WM capacity. Practitioner Summary: Working memory (WM) capacity helps account for inter-individual variability in operator performance in networked unmanned aerial vehicle supervisory tasks. This is useful for reliable performance prediction near experimental conditions via linear models; robust statistical prediction beyond experimental conditions via Gaussian process models and probabilistic inference about unknown task conditions/WM capacities via Bayesian network models.},

@article{Ahmed-TRO-2012,
	Abstract = {This paper considers Bayesian data fusion of con-ventional robot sensor information with ambiguous human-generated categorical information about continuous world states of interest. First, it is shown that such soft information can be generally modeled via hybrid continuous-to-discrete likelihoods based on the softmax function. A new hybrid fusion procedure, called variational Bayesian importance sampling (VBIS), is then introduced to combine the strengths of variational Bayes approximations and fast Monte Carlo methods to produce reliable posterior estimates for Gaussian priors and softmax likelihoods. VBIS is then extended to more general fusion problems involving complex Gaussian mixture (GM) priors and multimodal softmax likelihoods, leading to accurate GM approximations of highly non-Gaussian fusion posteriors for a wide range of robot sensor data and soft human data. Experiments for hardware-based mul-titarget search missions with a cooperative human-autonomous robot team show that humans can serve as highly informative sensors through proper data modeling and fusion, and that VBIS provides reliable and scalable Bayesian fusion estimates via GMs.},

The human-computer augmented node is a mobile sensor unit where the human contributes both the sensors and the sensor carrying ``platform'', while the computer runs both a decentralized Bayesian fusion node and a decentralized Bayesian control negotiation algorithm. The individual controllers iteratively negotiate anonymously in the information space to find cooperative search plans based on both observed and predicted information that explicitly consider the human motion model, its sensors detection functions, as well as the target arbitrary motion model. The results of a search experiment conducted with ten human carrying small portable computers with wireless communication are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the approach.},

@article{Ahmed2012a,
	Abstract = {Discriminative subclass models can provide good estimates of complex `continuous to discrete' conditional probabilities for hybrid Bayesian network models. However, the conventional approach of specifying deterministic `hard' subclasses via unsupervised clustering can lead to inaccurate models. The multimodal softmax (MMS) model is presented as a new probabilistic discriminative subclass model that overcomes this unreliability. By invoking fully probabilistic latent `soft' subclasses, MMS permits learning via standard statistical methods without requiring explicit clustering/relabeling of data. MMS is also shown to be closely related to the mixture of experts model and the generative Gaussian mixture classifier. Synthetic and benchmark classification results demonstrate the MMS model's correctness and usefulness for hybrid probabilistic modeling.},
